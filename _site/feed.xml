        <title>The calm before the storm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Calm? There was no calm! I was expecting the weeks leading up to our first day to consist of a bit of light reading and a few challenges here and there, but 3 days into the pre-course we seem to be in the thick of it already, and Iâ€™m already scared of falling behind. But I am already loving it ðŸ˜Š Here are my thoughts on the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I booked my interview at Makers I was presented with 12 hours worth of interview prep work, so I guess that was the point at which I said goodbye to my old life. After passing the interview Nikesh sent me some pre-pre-course material which kept me busy up until the pre-course meet up. At the time I thought it would save me some time later on, but Iâ€™ve now realised that the actual advantage is that I can delve deeper into the pre-course week 1 material and do a lot more research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems everything Iâ€™ve read and everyone Iâ€™ve spoken to has emphasised the same points really:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can say goodbye to your social life. Makers is your life now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is one of the hardest things you&#39;ll ever do but it will be totally worth it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The staff and your fellow students will become a very important part of your life. They&#39;ll constantly be there with you for the next 16 weeks and will help you when you&#39;re close to giving up and crying in the corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve already learnt not to take this advice lightly, and that everyone, without exception, needs to take it seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeek 1 has been about command line/bash/shell scripting (Iâ€™m still getting to grips with the terminology). Itâ€™s been great fun learning how to use the commands and feeling like weâ€™ve already started learning something fundamental that will no doubt come in useful to do even cooler things very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course material is fantastic, you can tell itâ€™s a tried and tested formula thatâ€™s been improved upon for each iteration (a new cohort starts doing this every 6 weeks). We were provided with tutorials and challenges that increase in difficulty by just the right amount. Often youâ€™ll be presented with a question that you half know the answer to, which makes you refer back to the tutorial, really fully understand what you read initially and then apply that knowledge. I feel like Iâ€™m learning a lot and very quickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ll sign off now by just sayingâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mkdir post-2
cd post-2
touch second-blog-post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha ha Iâ€™m already speaking in a crazy secret language that only coders understand!&lt;/p&gt;
