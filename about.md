I am currently studying at Makers Academy, London's leading Web Developer Bootcamp. 

"If you're interested in learning how to code, Makers Academy is a highly selective, 12 week, full-time course (with a 4 week part-time pre-course) in web development based in London's Silicon Roundabout. We accept only the top applicants into our code academy for a rigorous programme that culminates on graduation day, when we introduce them to London's top technology companies looking to hire entry-level developers." - www.makersacademy.com

Prior to this course, I worked in email marketing for a number of years. This allowed me to work with HTML, CSS and Photoshop daily and build up my design skills. I focussed on building 'smart' email campaigns which used simple programming logic to create highly data driven, personlised communications. I did a lot of work on mobile optimisation for different devices and screen sizes, putting thought into user experience and ensuring code was pixel perfect.

I taught myself JavaScript in 2014 and built my website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
