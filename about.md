I'm currently working as a UI Developer at Trainline. I attend a lot of meetups and the occasional conference, and am a particular fan of tech groups for women. In my spare time I can be found dancing in carnival parades, trying out tasty new foods or learning mad new coding skills.

I studied at Makers Academy, London's leading Web Developer Bootcamp in 2015.

"If you're interested in learning how to code, Makers Academy is a highly selective, 12 week, full-time course (with a 4 week part-time pre-course) in web development based in London's Silicon Roundabout. We accept only the top applicants into our code academy for a rigorous programme that culminates on graduation day, when we introduce them to London's top technology companies looking to hire entry-level developers." - www.makersacademy.com
