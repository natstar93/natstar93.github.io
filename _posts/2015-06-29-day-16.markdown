I spent the weekend having a lovely time in Copenhagen. The only non-lovely thing about it was that I spent several hours on a plane home that was going nowhere with no wifi or place to charge my laptop. Unable to look anything up, I fought my way through the first half of the challenge trying not to have a panic attack every time I noticed the status of my ever decreasing battery. Unsurprisingly, this greatly impacted my ability to do the weekend challenge. I'm not trying to make excuses, it's totally my own fault for having time away, but I've realised over the last few weeks that social events really have to take a backseat if I'm going to do the best I can. The seniors who are 6 weeks ahead of us have started their final projects, a fact that has lead the June cohort to collectively and metaphorically soil itself.

I did the rest of the work when I got home, the next morning and this evening and now have a 1 player working rock, paper scissors web app (harder than it sounds). I've also completed part of the 'extra work' involving setting up a 2 player game using multiple sessions. So all in all it didn't go too badly in the end.

Now to get my brain fully involved in the wonderful world of databases and make up for lost time!
