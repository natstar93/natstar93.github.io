**Most Important Things I Learned:**

&bull; Rails! I am feeling a lot more familiar with rails after the weekend challenge<br>
&bull; Stuff about databases - how tables are joined and accessed

**Things I Struggled With The Most:**

&bull; Active records associations part of the tutorial<br>
&bull; Getting everything done. I finished the week's walkthrough on Saturday so didn't start the challenge until later than usual

**Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:**

&bull; Get a better balance between pace and understanding<br>
&bull; Have an AH review - didn't get round to it last week<br>

**Other Experiences or General Feedback This Week:**

&bull; I still have 4 people to pair with (Jon N, Lucy O, Rob, Paul), but I keep being put with people I've already been with. I would ideally like to pair with everyone. Would it help to send round a google form so everyone can fill in the names of everyone they HAVEN'T paired with yet rather than working it out from the 'have paired with' matrix? I am happy to organise this if you like.<br>
&bull; Having lots of fun as usual :) Pretty pleased at some of the things we're now able to do. I found rails a bit of a struggle last week but the weekend challenge really helped a lot.
