**Most Important Things I Learned:**

&bull; Lots of datamapper configuration details!<br>
&bull; Testing with databases using factory girl and database cleaner<br>
&bull; How passwords work<br>
&bull; How controllers should be organised (e.g. users/new structure as a convention for creating something, delete methods being called using hidden fields)

**Things I Struggled With The Most:**

&bull; I was worried I didn't fully understand the setup properly. Hopefully having done an athletic restart and the weekend challenge will give me more confidence with this<br>
&bull; DataMapper methods


**Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:**

&bull; Go to bed earlier<br>
&bull; Complete weekend challenge earlier<br>
&bull; Spend evenings going over what I've learnt in the day instead of trying to do all of the extra bits of the last weekend challenge - I will save these for lab week<br>
&bull; Post on slack overflow more


**Other Experiences or General Feedback This Week:**

&bull; Really enjoying it! Confused about a few things as usual but I'm happy with the progress I made this week. I really can see the value in pairing with lots of different people now. Having a mix of people who like to get through things rapidly and people who like to talk through things and examine them in detail is a really great way to push yourself and learn loads.<br>
&bull; More fruit and breakfast please!
