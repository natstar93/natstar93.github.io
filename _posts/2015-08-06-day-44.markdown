Today we've been working on the Pairing Matrix project again, with all teams operating with skeleton staff. In a way it's easier with less people to cause merge conflicts, but it meant we couldn't move ahead with any extra features. We implemented a blacklist, and started implementing login since it became very necessary to the Blacklisting feature we were creating.

I've been researching final projects and am about to vote for three options I would like to work on, which will allow the coaches to organise us into groups. I also seem to have a backlog of little things I want to do, and am hoping to make a start this weekend since we have no homework for the first time in 12 weeks! I've also declared myself homework-free to family and friends though, so we'll see how much time I actually have..

Here's the list as it currently stands:

&bull; Do a MongoDB tutorial<br>
&bull; Create a full MEAN stack app (MongoDB, Express, Angular & Node)<br>
&bull; Create or improve READMEs for a few recent projects<br>
&bull; Get Amazon web services image uploading working<br>
&bull; Push projects incorporating the above to Heroku<br>
&bull; Pretty up some previous projects with CSS. Go easy on the Bootstrap and all out on the design and UX<br>
&bull; Read Ruby & JS books<br>
&bull; Read OOP books<br>
&bull; Revisit and improve earlier weeks' projects

Well.. that's enough to keep me going for quite a while I think!
