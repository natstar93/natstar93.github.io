<p>Today we’ve been working on the Pairing Matrix project again, with all teams operating with skeleton staff. In a way it’s easier with less people to cause merge conflicts, but it meant we couldn’t move ahead with any extra features. We implemented a blacklist, and started implementing login since it became very necessary to the Blacklisting feature we were creating.</p>

<p>I’ve been researching final projects and am about to vote for three options I would like to work on, which will allow the coaches to organise us into groups. I also seem to have a backlog of little things I want to do, and am hoping to make a start this weekend since we have no homework for the first time in 12 weeks! I’ve also declared myself homework-free to family and friends though, so we’ll see how much time I actually have..</p>

<p>Here’s the list as it currently stands:</p>

<p>• Do a MongoDB tutorial<br />
• Create a full MEAN stack app (MongoDB, Express, Angular &amp; Node)<br />
• Create or improve READMEs for a few recent projects<br />
• Get Amazon web services image uploading working<br />
• Push projects incorporating the above to Heroku<br />
• Pretty up some previous projects with CSS. Go easy on the Bootstrap and all out on the design and UX<br />
• Read Ruby &amp; JS books<br />
• Read OOP books<br />
• Revisit and improve earlier weeks’ projects</p>

<p>Well.. that’s enough to keep me going for quite a while I think!</p>
