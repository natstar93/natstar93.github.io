<p><strong>Most Important Things I Learned:</strong></p>

<p>• Lots of datamapper configuration details!<br />
• Testing with databases using factory girl and database cleaner<br />
• How passwords work<br />
• How controllers should be organised (e.g. users/new structure as a convention for creating something, delete methods being called using hidden fields)</p>

<p><strong>Things I Struggled With The Most:</strong></p>

<p>• I was worried I didn’t fully understand the setup properly. Hopefully having done an athletic restart and the weekend challenge will give me more confidence with this<br />
• DataMapper methods</p>

<p><strong>Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:</strong></p>

<p>• Go to bed earlier<br />
• Complete weekend challenge earlier<br />
• Spend evenings going over what I’ve learnt in the day instead of trying to do all of the extra bits of the last weekend challenge - I will save these for lab week<br />
• Post on slack overflow more</p>

<p><strong>Other Experiences or General Feedback This Week:</strong></p>

<p>• Really enjoying it! Confused about a few things as usual but I’m happy with the progress I made this week. I really can see the value in pairing with lots of different people now. Having a mix of people who like to get through things rapidly and people who like to talk through things and examine them in detail is a really great way to push yourself and learn loads.<br />
• More fruit and breakfast please!</p>
