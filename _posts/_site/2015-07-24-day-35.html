<p><strong>Most Important Things I Learned:</strong></p>

<p>• Rails! I am feeling a lot more familiar with rails after the weekend challenge<br />
• Stuff about databases - how tables are joined and accessed</p>

<p><strong>Things I Struggled With The Most:</strong></p>

<p>• Active records associations part of the tutorial<br />
• Getting everything done. I finished the week’s walkthrough on Saturday so didn’t start the challenge until later than usual</p>

<p><strong>Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:</strong></p>

<p>• Get a better balance between pace and understanding<br />
• Have an AH review - didn’t get round to it last week<br /></p>

<p><strong>Other Experiences or General Feedback This Week:</strong></p>

<p>• I still have 4 people to pair with (Jon N, Lucy O, Rob, Paul), but I keep being put with people I’ve already been with. I would ideally like to pair with everyone. Would it help to send round a google form so everyone can fill in the names of everyone they HAVEN’T paired with yet rather than working it out from the ‘have paired with’ matrix? I am happy to organise this if you like.<br />
• Having lots of fun as usual :) Pretty pleased at some of the things we’re now able to do. I found rails a bit of a struggle last week but the weekend challenge really helped a lot.</p>
