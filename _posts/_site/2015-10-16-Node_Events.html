<p>Callbacks are great, but when there are more than two events and/or they need to be called multiple times, events are used. They’re more flexible and more powerful… Plus you can kind of switch them on and off as you please.</p>

<p>Instead of using asynchronous functions which execute upon the return of a result, a number of event listeners are set up to watch for certain signals or state changes. These listeners are also known as Observers. Node.js has a module called ‘events’ which needs to be required in order for this all to work.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of event handlers and emitters:</p>

<pre><code>var events = require('events');
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

var myFirstEventHandler = function first() {
  console.log('First event handler fired');
}

eventEmitter.on('firstEvent', myFirstEventHandler);

eventEmitter.emit('firstEvent');
</code></pre>

<p>Run that with node and see what happens…</p>

<p>Also, check out what gets returned here if you type each line into a REPL environment:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; eventEmitter.on('firstEvent', myFirstEventHandler);

{ domain: null,
  _events: { firstEvent: [Function: first] },
  _maxListeners: 10 }
</code></pre>

<p>The event emitter is returned, so this can be used for chaining calls together.</p>

<p>Event listeners can be added and removed from the array of event listeners using methods such as <code>eventEmitter.addListener(event, listener)</code>. For a full list please see the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">docs</a>.</p>
